# Bespoke Post web exercise

Each month Bespoke Post delivers new boxes to our subscribers. This exercise is your chance to show us your HTML, CSS, & Javascript skills by creating part of a sample page that showcases some of our boxes. There is [a mockup of the page fragment here](https://github.com/bespokepost/html_test/raw/master/examples/mockup.jpg).

To complete this exercise, begin by cloning this repository. Your assignment is to build out a production-ready implementation of this page using HTML, CSS, & Javascript. Some notes:

* Keep in mind, our traffic is more than 50% mobile devices, so the design should be responsive. The mockup shows this content at 3 different breakpoints.
* The green bars overlaid on the mockup represent the grid system to be used for the layout.
* The top module is a basic "carousel" where the content can be cycled to feature 4 different products. Don't worry about implementing any sophisticated transition effects but the copy and images should change together.
* There are images for each of the products in the `images` folder.
* There is copy provided for each product below.


When you are done please follow these instructions:

1. Zip up your git repository and send it to us at: dev+jobs@bespokepost.com with "Web Engineer Test" as the subject line.
2. If you've opted to use something like sass, please provide build instructions and make sure the repo you send over is ready to be built.
3. Do NOT post your work to a public Github repo and send us a Pull Request, we wouldn't want any other applicants to copy your work.

### Good luck!
