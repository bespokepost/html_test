# Bespoke Post markup exercise

Each month Bespoke Post delivers new boxes to our subscribers. This exercise is your chance to show us your HTML, CSS, & Javascript skills by creating a sample box page. There is a a PDF mockup of the page included in this repo.

To complete this exercise, begin by cloning this repository. Your assignment is to build out this page using HTML, CSS, & Javascript. Some notes:

* Please use placeholder images (e.g. http://placehold.it/940x540.png&text=Top+Slide) for now
* The right module should scroll with the page, but once it reaches the top of the window it should become "sticky" and not scroll off screen.
* The big blue image acts as a tabbed interface. Clicking any of the three links below it should change the image and the text overlaid on top of the image. The images should fade in/out and the text should fade in *after* the image has changed.
* The required fonts are included in this repo
* You should built this with reusability in mind, if that was going to be a real box page we'd want to be able to reuse the markup, styles and js for the next monthly box as well.
* You can use coffeescript & sass if you're so inclined.

When you are done please follow these instructions:

1. Zip up your git repository and send it to us at: jobs@bespokepost.com with "HTML Test" as the subject line.
2. If you've opted to use coffescript or sass, please provide build instructions and make sure the repo you send over is ready to be built.
3. Do NOT post your work to a public Github repo and send us a Pull Request, we wouldn't want any other applicants to copy your work.

Good luck!
